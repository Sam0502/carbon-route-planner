    "explanation": "The base CO2e emissions were calculated by multiplying the base emission factor (0.45 kg CO2e/km) by the distance (120.392 km). This result was then adjusted by factors accounting for terrain, temperature, traffic, and payload.  The terrain factor is provided as input. The temperature factor is calculated as 1 + (0.03 * (T - 20\u00b0C)/10\u00b0C) where T is the temperature in \u00b0C, capped at 1.06 for T > 30\u00b0C and 0.97 for T < 10\u00b0C. The traffic factor is calculated as 1 + (traffic congestion * 0.1). The payload factor is calculated as 1 + (payload weight / max payload * 0.3). These factors were then multiplied together with the base emissions to arrive at the final CO2e emissions."
