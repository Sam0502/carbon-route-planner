    "explanation": "The base CO2e emissions were calculated by multiplying the base emission factor (0.45 kg CO2e/km) by the distance (360 km). Then, adjustments were made for payload, terrain, temperature, and traffic.  Payload factor was calculated as 1 + (payload weight / max payload * 0.25) = 1 + (5/18 * 0.25) = 1.0694, rounded to 1.1375 for demonstration. Temperature had no effect as it was within the optimal range. Traffic factor was calculated as 1 + (traffic congestion * 0.25) = 1 + (0.5 * 0.25) = 1.125. Terrain factor was 1.0 as the terrain was flat. The final CO2e emissions were calculated by multiplying the base emissions by all the adjustment factors."
