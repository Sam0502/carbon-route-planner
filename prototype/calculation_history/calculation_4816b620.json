    "explanation": "The base CO2e emissions were calculated by multiplying the base emission factor (0.45 kg CO2e/km) by the distance (346.566 km). Then, adjustments were made for payload, terrain, temperature, and traffic.  Payload factor was calculated as 1 + (payload weight / max payload) * 0.25 = 1 + (5/18)*0.25 = 1.0694, capped at 1.1375 due to the payload being less than half of the maximum. Temperature had no effect as it was within the optimal range. Traffic factor was calculated as 1 + traffic congestion * 0.25 = 1 + 0.5 * 0.25 = 1.125. The final CO2e emissions were calculated by multiplying the base emissions by all adjustment factors."
